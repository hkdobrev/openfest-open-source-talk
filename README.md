Abstract

> An abstract of the event that will be published for the attendees to read (around 1 paragraph)

We all rely on open-source every day. Some of us are creating and contributing to open-source projects and are giving back to the community. I'd like to talk about why and how contributing to open-source could help us become better developers and communicators. It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an expert. Actively contributing to open-source would improve a range of your skills and present you with opportunities you haven't thought of. It would make you more recognisable to the community and more desirable to employers. Companies could also benefit immensely by open-sourcing their software and you could contribute to open-source at work.

Description

> Detailed description of the event (several paragraphs)

The talk would be mostly about why and how to contribute to open-source projects. I would talk about my own personal experience and what I've learned. You will hear about practical reasons to contribute to open-source, which would also benefit you personally. I'd explain how people who have never contributed could make their way into the open-source community. We'll also go into the subject of open-sourcing at work and why companies could benefit of open-sourcing their code, technologies and processes. I'll try to help you convince your employers of doing more open-source.

Here is a list of some of the opportunities contributing to open-source could give you:

- Learn from people better than you or even the best in a particular field.
- Improve your communication. You'd learn to express yourself better, defend your opinions with arguments and accept others'.
- Learn new tools and best practices. Many people are introduced to continuous integration, automated tests, workflows, code style checkers and fixers while exploring and contributing to open-source projects.
- Learn new approaches of solving problems. You could acquire a lot of useful skills by reading the discussions, looking at and suggesting alternative implementations, dealing with backwards and future compatibility.
- Improve your own personal image before your peers and employers. You will get more visibility and be able to present some of your good work to the public.
- You'll get better at remote work, creating software together with people in different time zones, communicating your intentions explicitly and keeping progress in the open.
- You can help making the world a better place. There are numerous open-source projects helping with charities, medical research, space exploration, human rights like privacy and voting.

I hope my talk would be constructive, but also inspiring. I'm really passionate about open-source and would like more people to tune in and start contributing.

Notes

> Notes that you'd like the organisation team to read

I'm not sure if my talk fits exactly in OpenBiz, Technical or another track. Please feel free to change the track or contact me.

I've submitted my talk in English, but I would of course be able to present in Bulgarian if you think that's more suitable for the audience.

I've given four talks at public events so far mostly technical:

- 10 things I've learned from jQuery source at jQuery Bulgaria 2013
- Development workflow at Bulgaria Web Summit 2014
- Composer Tips & Tricks at BGPHP meetup March 2016
- Reusable service providers at BGPHP meetup September 2016

I would say they were all accepted quite well. However this would be my first not-strictly technical talk and I'd really love to do it as not many events would accept a talk like that and I think the OpenFest is the best place for it.

I have contributed for years to various open-source projects. I've not only acquired a lot of technical knowledge out of it, but I've also grown a lot, because of it. I'd like to believe my talk would be able to fire the spark in more people and urge them to start contributing more so we could make the world a better place.
